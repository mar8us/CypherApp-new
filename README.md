# CypherApp-new

Hello! 

This is a project created for education. 

background information for this project:
- Visual Studio 2017 CLR project
- using OpenSSL 3.0 to implement basic cryptography alghoritm like AES, RSA, SHA-2

To compile this project, you have to install OpenSSL and add it to Visual Studio. I did this using vcpkg because I think it's a simple way to achieve this.
vcpkg: https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg

After you installing vcpkg you can proceed to install OpenSSL. Use this command in the terminal:
'''.\vcpkg install openssl:x64-windows'''
